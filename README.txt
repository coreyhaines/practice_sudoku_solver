== DESCRIPTION:

This is a set of cucumber features for writing a sudoku solver. The intent is to jump start you in your practice.

NOTE: This is under intense change right now, as I develop the basic structure. Please keep this in mind if you fork the repo.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:


== SYNOPSIS:

One of the main roadblocks for engaging in focused practice in development is the initial setup of what to practice. Finding sudoku boards (unsolved alongside their solutions) in an electronic form is not easy, much less placing them in a format that you can use as automated acceptance tests.

This repository is intended to help alleviate that headache by providing a set of pre-built cucumber features for developing a full-features sudoku solver. There will be cucumber specs for validating a board is solved, solving trivial boards (for example, single digit board), as well as progressively more difficult (Easy, Medium, Hard).

My recommended approach to using this repository is to take the following steps:
1) Fork this repo
2) Make a branch for your solution
3) Create your solution using that branch as your root
4) Go back to master
5) Repeat 2-4
6) Be a more skilled programmer

Each time you solve it, try to focus on a different practice or technique that you want to get better at. TDD? Programming by 'wishful thinking?' SOLID principles? All these can be practiced, and, since you don't have to worry about the setup, you can focus directly on furthering your skills.

I will be grabbing boards off http://www.sudokupuzz.com/ to include in the cucumber features
